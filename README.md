### Etch a Sketch

For this project, I am trying to make an "Etch-a-Sketch"-like canvas using Javascript.
The purpose of this project is to practice DOM manipulation. For example, to get the cursor to mimic a drawing stylus, event listeners have to be placed in the canvas so that they can be used by the script.
